# Recipe Ratings Revealed: A Data-Driven Culinary Journey¶
Author: Athira Rajiv

## Introduction
In this project, I explore a comprehensive dataset of recipes and their corresponding user interactions. The main question I aim to answer is: **"What types of recipes tend to have higher average ratings?"** Gaining insight into this question can provide valuable information into culinary trends and preferences, helping home cooks who are looking to try new recipes or chefs and food bloggers aiming to create content that resonates with their audiences. The insights gained from answering this question can even reach audiences who don't usually cook, encouraging them to experiment with new ingredients and cuisines, and enriching their cooking experience. 

The dataset comprises two main files: `Recipes` and `Interactions`, containing the recipes and reviews posted since 2008. The relevant columns from these datasets include:

The ratings dataset contains 731,927 rows, indicating that there are 731,927 unique reviews for a variety of recipes.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

The data cleaning process involved several key steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. First, I merged recipes and interactions on the recipe_id column to combine recipe details with user interactions. To handle missing values, I replaced ratings of 0 with np.nan as a rating of 0 likely indicates the absence of a rating rather than a legitimate score, thus preventing it from skewing the average ratings. 

Next, I performed feature engineering by creating new features from the nutrition column. Specifically, I created separate columns for each unique element in the nutrition column, so that values for 'calories', 'total_fat_PDV', 'sugar_PDV', 'sodium_PDV', 'protein_PDV', 'saturated_fat_PDV', and 'carbohydrates_PDV' are stored in different columns. In order to do this, I converted the string representations of lists in the nutrition columns into actual Python list objects. I did the same for the 'tags' column to convert the values into actual lists for easier data manipulation. Additionally, I capped the minutes column at 1440 minutes (24 hours) to remove outliers and ensure all values represented valid preparation times. I also converted the values in the submitted column to pd.datetime for consistency and better handling of date values.

Furthermore, I created an average ratings column by grouping the data by id and calculating the average rating for each recipe. This helped me incorporate a summary measure of user feedback into my analysis. Lastly, I created a has_desserts_tag column, which contains a boolean value -- the column contains True if the recipe has the "desserts" tag and False otherwise. This column is particularly relevant for the hypothesis test I conducted (see **Hypothesis Testing**) and the subsequent sections. 


My cleaned dataframe contains 83194 rows and 21 columns. I have omitted the "steps" column below for better readability  of the dataset. Here are the first five rows of the cleaned DataFrame (excluding the "steps" column, which is included in the actual cleaned DataFrame):
